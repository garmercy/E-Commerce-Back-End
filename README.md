* node server.js
```
## User Story

```

## Application Acceptance Criteria:
```
* GIVEN a functional Express.js API
* WHEN I add my database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file
* THEN I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize
* WHEN I enter schema and seed commands
* THEN a development database is created and is seeded with test data
* WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
